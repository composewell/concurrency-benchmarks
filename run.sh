# --min-duration 0 means exactly one iteration per sample. We use a million

# done by the benchmarking tool.
#
# Benchmarking tool by default discards the first iteration to remove
# aberrations due to initial evaluations etc. We do not discard it because we
# are anyway doing iterations in the benchmarking code and many of them so that
# any constant factor gets amortized and anyway it is a cost that we pay in
# real life.
#
# We can pass --min-samples value from the command line as second argument
# after the benchmark name in case we want to use more than one sample.
